		<p>Welcome!</p>

		<p>I am a theoretical physicist currently on my last year of a masters degree in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics(LQCD). In my degree I have built a program for generating and flowing field configuration adhering to Yang-Mills theory.</p>

		<p>This is a small page <em> under construction </em> I am building in which I aim to present what I have created as well as what my academic interests are.</p>
